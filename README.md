# MMER DEVELOPMENT

## Description

Connecting clients and developers to build web apps.

<!-- Which we will show you properly soon. -->

MMER DEVELOPMENT is a web app development agency that aims to help clients build their own apps. 

The app opens with standard website style design so that users can learn more about us, how the process will work and what to expect from our services.

A section is placed on the home route so that users can complete our entry form. Resulting in a user logging in or creating an account.

Once in the app they are taken to the portal route. This protected route will be the clients home as they set up and monitor their projects. Here clients will be able to top up their prepaid hours and create an allocation for MMER's development team to work on their project. 

Unfortunately I was not able to complete the features outlined above at this very moment. So everything works up to pressing the 'Create a project' button. 

Aspects of the app that can / will be improved in the future: 
- Password validation (length, digit and special character)
- Add a way to change legal docs and then change all users terms to false. Then add a check that they need to accept the updated terms to continue... 
- Fix the paymentMethod to reference another model with name, card number, expiry, cvv
- Stages: 0 = Idea / needs to be reviewed before continuing, 1 = designing / planning / thinking / screenflows, 2 = developing, 3 = deploy / maintain / new features...
